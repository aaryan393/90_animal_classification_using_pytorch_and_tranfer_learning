# Animal Classification with PyTorch and Transfer Learning

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation for classifying 90 different animals using transfer learning techniques. The project constits of dumpy CNN for the propose of get the right shape for matrix and pre-trained models

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of 90 different animal species. It is structured in a way that facilitates training deep learning models for image classification tasks. Due to licensing constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. You will need to acquire it separately and organize it into the appropriate directory structure.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision


You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install torch torchvision 
```
